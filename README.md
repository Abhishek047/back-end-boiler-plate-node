Title: Back-end with Node Boilerplate

Description:
This GitHub repository provides a boilerplate for building the back-end of a React application using Node.js. It serves as a starting point for developing robust and scalable server-side functionality to support your React front-end.

Features:

1. **Node.js**: The boilerplate utilizes Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, to create the server-side application.
2. **Express.js**: It includes the Express.js framework, which simplifies the development of web applications and APIs with Node.js.
3. **REST API**: The boilerplate sets up a basic RESTful API structure, allowing you to easily define routes, handle requests, and manage resources.
4. **Database Integration**: It incorporates a database integration layer, such as MongoDB with Mongoose or PostgreSQL with Sequelize, to enable seamless communication between your Node.js server and the database.
5. **Authentication and Authorization(TBI)**: The repository provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication, to secure your API endpoints and manage user access.
6. **Middleware**: It includes common middleware configurations, such as body parsing, CORS handling, and error handling, to enhance the functionality and security of your Node.js server.
7. **Environment Configuration**: The boilerplate supports environment-specific configurations using tools like dotenv, allowing you to manage different settings for development, testing, and production environments.
8. **Logging(TBI)**: It incorporates logging capabilities, using it's own middleware
9. **Testing(TBI)**: The repository provides a testing setup with frameworks like Jest, along with tools like Supertest, to facilitate automated testing of your Node.js server and APIs.
10. **Deployment-ready**: The configuration includes scripts and guidelines for deploying your Node.js server to popular hosting platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.

Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Customize the boilerplate to fit your specific project requirements, such as adding database models, defining routes, or implementing authentication logic.
4. Start the server using `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
5. Test the server using `npm run test` or `yarn run test`.
6. Deploy your server to your preferred hosting platform following the deployment guidelines.
